# Game-Theoretical Model for Pen-Testing in Industrial Control Systems

In this approach we evaluate the cybersecurity risk in terms of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a zero-sum game in between a pen-tester equipped with an attack tree and a defender equipped with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and a strategic response graph model. The proposed approach is composed of three layers: the functional network layer, the security layer, and the game theory layer. Each agent has the best possible response given the portfolio of played strategies.

## Tool Introduction:

The presented Python tool make use of the Monte Carlo method to evaluate the payoffs given different variants of randomness, and selected strategies for each agent.

In this directory we provide two files for conducting the simulation:

* graph1.txt: Input file describing the Industrial Control System (ICS) network.
* SIM1.py:    Conduct a Monte Carlo Simulation between both agents based on random strategies.
