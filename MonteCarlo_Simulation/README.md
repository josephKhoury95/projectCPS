# Game-Theoretical Model for Pen-Testing in Industrial Control Systems

In this approach we evaluate the risk in terms of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a zero-sum game in between a pen-tester equipped with an attack tree and a defender equipped with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and a strategic response graph model. The proposed approach is composed of three layers: the functional network layer, the security layer, and the game theory layer. Each agent has the best possible response given the portfolio of played strategies.
The presented Python tool is developed to evaluate the payoffs given different variants of randomness, and selected strategies for each agent.
